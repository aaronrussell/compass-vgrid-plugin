// The following generates the default grids provided by the css version of 960.gs
+grid_system(12)

+grid_system(16)
  
// But most compass users prefer to construct semantic layouts like so (two column layout with header and footer):
 
!vgrid_columns = 24
.two-column
  +grid_container
  #header, #footer, #sidebar, #main-content
    +grid_unit_base
  #header, #footer
    +grid_width(24)
  #sidebar
    +grid_width(8)
  #main-content
    +grid_width(16)
 
// When in doubt, try a clearfix
.clearfix
  +clearfix
