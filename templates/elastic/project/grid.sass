// The following generates the default grids provided by the css version of Variable Grid System
+grid_system(12)
  
// But most compass users prefer to construct semantic layouts like so (two column layout with header and footer):
!vgrid_columns = 16
#wrap
  +grid_container
  #header, #footer
    +grid(16)
  #left-nav
    +grid(5)
  #main-content
    +grid_prefix(1)
    +grid(10)
 
// When in doubt, try a +clearfix mixin ;)
